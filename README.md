# README (EMULATING FEDERATED LEARNING ON AN FPGA CLUSTERâ€‹)

This project implements Federated Learning in fulfillment of the final project for ECE 8893-Parallel Programming for FPGAs (Spring 2023). The federated averaging server here is a raspberry pi, and the nodes are PynqZ2 FPGA boards.

The source code folder contains the kernel code files that run on the PL of each FPGA board, and provides a script to run HDL synthesis in Vitis HLS.

## Requirements

Can be run in a standard Linux environment with Vitis HLS installed. Code references for this project are the lab 2 code from this course, and a PyTorch based model script that is also provided in this folder.

The instructors may use the code as they please. We are willing to open-source our code.

## Steps to run

## To launch the PyTorch model ##
For initial weights to train the kernel, Pytorch_Model.ipynb was used. The same returns, weights for both the Convolution and FC layers. Since the kernel is doing transfer learning, the Convolution weights are used for inference and the FC weights are used as initial points for training.
To run Pytorch_Model.ipynb, you may use Google Colab. Before that ensure that the training and testing dataset are uploaded appropriately.

## To check the functional correctness ##
# 1. Make
```
make clean
make hls_sim (for float)
make (for ap_fixed)
```
The number of input training data samples per epoch can be changed by changing the SET_SIZE param in conv.h file, and the input_feature_set_linear in inference_testbench_v3.cpp. Currently SET_SIZE is set to 2, meaning only 2 input per epoch. It has been tested for up to 3 input images per epoch.

# 2. Running C-simulation
```
./csim.out
```
## To Build the bitstream ##
# 1. Running Vitis HLS
```
make synth
```
# 2. Run the Vivado and generate the bitstream using the IP generated after synthesis

## Steps for board run ##
# 1. Launch the server
On the server machine upload the Server_code.ipynb file. This code launches the server and sends the initial Fully Connected layer weights (FC Weights) to the node machines (FPGAs) via sockets. It receives the updated values from each of the machines, averages them and sends them back to each of the clients. This is done for two epochs and the overall execution time tracked.

# 2. Launch the clients
On each of the 4 client machines upload the client_<client_ID(1,2,3,4)>_host.ipynb file along with the bitstream generated (both the .bit and .hwh file). This code receives the FC weights from the server, executes the convolution on the kernel and sends the updated weights back. The kernel also returns the output value to calculate the error. As in the server, the overall execution time is tracked here as well.
